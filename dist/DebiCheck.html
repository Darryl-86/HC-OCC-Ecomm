      DebiCheck is a new secure debit order payment system that means you have to approve your debit order before your purchase can be processed. This puts you in control of your debit orders and keeps your money safe. To approve your debit order, look out for a message from your bank.</p> 

      <p>
        <span>What is DebiCheck?</span>
        DebiCheck is the name for a specific type of debit order. A DebiCheck debit order is one that you electronically confirm on a once-off basis, generally at the start of your agreement.
      </p>  


      <p>
        <span>How does DebiCheck work?</span>
        When you pay via debit order, you will receive a message from your bank for you to confirm the debit order information is correct. The way in which you can confirm your DebiCheck debit order will be communicated to you by your bank. It is important that your contact details, especially your cellphone number, is up to date with your bank. Please note that if you do not confirm your DebiCheck, we will be unable to process your order and you will need to place your order again.
      </p> 


      <p>
        <span>Why should I set up a DebiCheck debit order?</span>
        Setting up a DebiCheck debit order means your account will be safe and protected from unauthorised debit order amounts as your bank will now know what you have agreed to and will not allow your DebiCheck to be processed outside the terms that you have confirmed. Please note that if you do not confirm your DebiCheck, we will be unable to process your order and you will need to place your order again.
      </p>
